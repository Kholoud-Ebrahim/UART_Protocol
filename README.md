# UART
- There are many serial communication protocols as I2C, UART and SPI.
- A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is a block of circuitry responsible for implementing serial communication.
- UART is Full Duplex protocol (data transmission in both directions simultaneously).
- `Transmitting UART` converts parallel data from the master device (e.g.,
CPU) into serial form and transmit in serial to receiving UART.
- `Receiving UART` will then convert the serial data back into parallel data for the receiving device
